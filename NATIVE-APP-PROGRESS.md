## 📁 Next: Create Project Structure

Run these commands in a **NEW PowerShell** window:

```powershell
cd g:\tabibak-app\tabibak_native

# Create folder structure
mkdir lib\config
mkdir lib\models
mkdir lib\services
mkdir lib\providers
mkdir lib\screens\patient
mkdir lib\screens\doctor
mkdir lib\screens\receptionist

## 📝 Important Notes

### **To Run Commands:**
You need to open a **NEW PowerShell window** because Flutter isn't in the current PATH.

### **Alternative:**
If you can't run Flutter commands, I can create all files manually and you can build later when Flutter is available.

## 🎉 Ready to Continue!

**Option A:** Run `flutter pub get` and let me know when it's done

**Option B:** I'll create all the code files now, and you can install dependencies later

Which would you prefer? 🚀
