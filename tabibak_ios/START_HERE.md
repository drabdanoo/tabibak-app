⚠️ **Apple Account** - Needed for App Store
✅ **Separate from Android** - Your Android app is untouched
✅ **Independent** - Can develop both separately

## Troubleshooting

### App won't run?
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### WebView shows blank?
- Check internet connection
- Verify URL is correct
- Try hard refresh

### Build fails?
```bash
cd ios
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
flutter run
```
