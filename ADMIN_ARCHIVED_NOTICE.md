# Admin Panel Archived - CLI Tool Implemented

## What Happened
The web-based admin panel (`admin.html`, `admin-login.html`, `debug-admin.html`) has been **archived** and replaced with a secure command-line tool.

## Why This Change?
- **Security**: CLI tools eliminate web exposure vulnerabilities
- **Simplicity**: Direct Firebase Admin SDK access without authentication conflicts
- **Reliability**: No browser compatibility or session management issues
- **Performance**: Direct database operations

## New Admin Solution
Use the **manage-doctors.js** CLI tool for all admin functions:

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Download service account key from Firebase Console
# 2. Save as service-account-key.json
# 3. Run commands:
```

### Doctor Management
```bash
# Create doctor
node manage-doctors.js add "Dr. John Smith" "john@clinic.com" "Cardiology"

# List all doctors  
node manage-doctors.js list

# Delete doctor (with confirmation)
node manage-doctors.js delete "dr.john.smith@clinic.com"

# Bulk cleanup helpers
node manage-doctors.js cleanup-auth        # remove old Firebase Auth accounts
node manage-doctors.js remove-all         # archive all doctor profiles (with confirmation)
```

Each creation run prints the temporary password so you can share secure login instructions with the doctor. They sign in, change the password on first login, and the account becomes fully active.

## Archived Files
- `admin.html.archived` - Main admin panel
- `admin-login.html.archived` - Admin login page  
- `debug-admin.html.archived` - Debug admin interface
- `mount-admin.js.archived` - Admin JS functionality

## Documentation Updated
- Removed admin references from `index.html`
- Updated guides to reflect CLI approach
- Created comprehensive `DOCTOR_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Result**: More secure, maintainable admin system using Firebase Admin SDK directly.
