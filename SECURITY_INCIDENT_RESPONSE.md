**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## üìã Incident Summary

**What Happened:**
- Service account key was accidentally committed to GitHub
- Key ID: `cb0342fa6194ab1a7635e7742be804af84a15653`
- Service Account: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@medconnect-2.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- File: `service-account-key.json`
- Discovered by: Google Cloud Platform

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
- Anyone with this key can access your Firebase project
- Could read/write/delete data
- Could incur unauthorized charges
- Could compromise patient data

---

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (COMPLETED)

### **Step 1: Disable the Exposed Key**
- [ ] Log in to Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Go to: IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts
- [ ] Find: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@medconnect-2.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- [ ] Click on service account
- [ ] Go to: Keys tab
- [ ] Find key ID: `cb0342fa6194ab1a7635e7742be804af84a15653`
- [ ] Click 3-dot menu ‚Üí Delete
- [ ] Confirm deletion

### **Step 2: Create New Service Account Key**
- [ ] In same service account, click: Create Key
- [ ] Select: JSON format
- [ ] Download new key file
- [ ] **STORE SECURELY** - don't commit to GitHub!

### **Step 3: Remove from GitHub**
- [ ] Delete `service-account-key.json` from GitHub
- [ ] Use git to remove from history:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached service-account-key.json
  git commit -m "Remove exposed service account key"
  git push origin main
  ```

### **Step 4: Update `.gitignore`**
- [ ] Added patterns to prevent future exposure:
  ```
  service-account-key.json
  *-key.json
  *-credentials.json
  firebase-key.json
  secrets/
  credentials/
  ```

### **Step 5: Update Code**
- [ ] Replace hardcoded key with environment variables
- [ ] Use `.env` file for local development
- [ ] Use Google Cloud Secret Manager for production

## üîç Security Audit Checklist

### **Access Review**
- [ ] Check Cloud Logging for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review API calls from exposed key
- [ ] Check for unauthorized data access
- [ ] Review billing for unusual charges
- [ ] Check for new service accounts created
- [ ] Review IAM role changes

### **Account Security**
- [ ] Enable 2FA on Google account
- [ ] Review recent login activity
- [ ] Check connected apps & services
- [ ] Review OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Check for unauthorized API keys

### **Project Security**
- [ ] Review all service account keys
- [ ] Delete unused keys
- [ ] Rotate all keys regularly
- [ ] Enable Cloud Audit Logs
- [ ] Enable VPC Service Controls
- [ ] Enable Binary Authorization

## üîê Secure Key Management

### **DO's:**
‚úÖ Use environment variables for keys  
‚úÖ Store keys in `.env` (in `.gitignore`)  
‚úÖ Use Google Cloud Secret Manager  
‚úÖ Use Firebase Secrets for Cloud Functions  
‚úÖ Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)  
‚úÖ Use service account impersonation  
‚úÖ Enable Cloud Audit Logs  
‚úÖ Restrict key permissions (least privilege)  

### **DON'Ts:**
‚ùå Don't commit keys to GitHub  
‚ùå Don't share keys via email  
‚ùå Don't hardcode keys in source code  
‚ùå Don't use keys in client-side code  
‚ùå Don't store keys in public folders  
‚ùå Don't use same key for multiple services  
‚ùå Don't forget to delete old keys  
‚ùå Don't ignore key rotation

## üìù Secure Implementation Example

### **Before (‚ùå INSECURE):**
```javascript
// functions/index.js
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./service-account-key.json');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
});
```

### **After (‚úÖ SECURE):**
```javascript
// functions/index.js
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// For Cloud Functions (automatic)
admin.initializeApp();

// For local development (use .env)
if (process.env.FIREBASE_CONFIG) {
  const serviceAccount = JSON.parse(process.env.FIREBASE_CONFIG);
  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
  });
}
```

### **.env File (Local Development Only):**
```
FIREBASE_CONFIG={"type":"service_account","project_id":"medconnect-2",...}
```

### **.env.example (Commit to GitHub):**
```
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
FIREBASE_CONFIG={"type":"service_account","project_id":"medconnect-2",...}
```

## üöÄ Prevention for Future

### **1. GitHub Protection**
- [ ] Enable branch protection rules
- [ ] Require code reviews
- [ ] Enable secret scanning
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks

### **2. Pre-commit Hook**
Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent committing sensitive files
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(service-account|credentials|\.env)" | grep -v "\.example"; then
  echo "ERROR: Attempting to commit sensitive files!"
  echo "Add to .gitignore and try again."
  exit 1
fi
```

### **3. GitHub Secrets Scanning**
- [ ] Enable in repository settings
- [ ] Configure custom patterns
- [ ] Set up notifications

### **4. Regular Audits**
- [ ] Monthly: Review all keys
- [ ] Quarterly: Rotate all keys
- [ ] Quarterly: Audit IAM roles
- [ ] Quarterly: Review Cloud Logging
